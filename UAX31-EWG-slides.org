* C++ Identifier Syntax using Unicode Standard Annex 31
- That C++ identifiers match the pattern
  #+begin_quote
  (XID_Start + _ ) + XID_Continue*.
  #+end_quote
- That portable source is required to be normalized as NFC.
- That using unassigned code points be ill-formed.

** Problem this fixes : NL 029
Allowed characters include those from U+200b until U+206x; these are zero-width and control characters that lead to impossible to type names, indistinguishable names and unusable code & compile errors (such as those accidentally including RTL modifiers).

** Other "wierd identifier code points"
- The middle dot ¬∑ which looks like an operator.
- Many non-combining "modifiers" and accent marks, such as ¬¥ and ¬® and Íìª which don't really make sense on their own.
- "Tone marks" from various languages, including À´ (similar to a box-drawing character ‚îú which is an operator).
- The "Greek question mark" Õæ (see below)
- Symbols which are simply not linguistic, such as €û and ‡ºí.

** UAX 31 - Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax
- Follows the same principles as originally used for C++
- Actively maintained
- Stable

** XID_Start and XID_Continue
   - Unicode database defined properties
   - Closed under normalization for all four forms
   - Once a code point has the property it is never removed
   - Roughly:
     - Start == letters
     - Continue == Start + numbers + some punctuation

* The Emoji Problem
  - The emoji-like code points that we knew about were excluded
  - We included all unassigned code points
  - Emoji 'support' is an accident, incomplete, and broken

** Some examples

#+begin_src C++
int ‚è∞ = 0; //not valid
int üïê = 0; // valid

int ‚ò†Ô∏è = 0; //not valid
int üíÄ = 0; // valid

int ‚úãÔ∏è = 0; //not valid
int üëä = 0; // valid

int ‚úàÔ∏è = 0; //not valid
int üöÄ = 0; // valid

int ‚òπÔ∏è = 0; //not valid
int üòÄ = 0; // valid
#+end_src

** ‚ôÄ and ‚ôÇ are disallowed

#+begin_src C++
// Valid
    bool üë∑ = true; //  Construction Worker
// Not valid
    bool üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄ = false; // Woman Construction Worker ({Construction Worker}{ZWJ}{Female Sign})

#+end_src

~~~

** Fixing the emoji problem would mean being inventive

   Being inventive in an area outside our expertise is HARD

   Adopting UAX31 as a base to move forward is conservative

* Other adopters
  - Java (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.8)
  - Python 3 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131/
  - Erlang https://www.erlang.org/erlang-enhancement-proposals/eep-0040.html
  - Rust https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2457-non-ascii-idents.html
  - JS https://tc39.es/ecma262/

* We have wording
  The paper has details, wording was smithed by Jens.
