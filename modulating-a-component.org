Proposal submissions due	February 14
Conference May 2, 2021 - May 7, 2021
* Abstract
  This talk will walk through creating a C++ 20 module interface and the implementation of a simple data structure, a functional tree. This will cover how to control export of types and inline code, hiding an implementation, and making sure that necessary un-exported definitions are still reachable.
