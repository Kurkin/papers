# Introduction # {#intro}

This proposal continues the effort R. Martinho Fernandes initiated that
culminated in [@P1097]
https://wg21.link/p1097r2 "Named character escapes".
This proposal does not deviate from the general design intent in
Fernandes' work, but does deviate in a few details. See the
[History](#history) and [Proposal](#proposal) sections for more
information.

C++ programmers have been able to portably use characters outside of the
basic source character set in character and string literals since the
introduction of
[*universal-character-name*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s
in C++11. For example:

```C++
// UTF-32 character literal with U+0100 {LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON}
U'\u0100'
// UTF-8 string literal with U+0100 {LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON} U+0300 {COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT}
u8"\u0100\u0300"
```

This proposal enables the above literals to be written using Unicode
assigned names instead of Unicode code point values.

```C++
U'\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON}' // Equivalent to U'\u0100'
u8"\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON}\N{COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT" // Equivalent to u8"\u0100\u0300"
```

This paper discusses and links to work completed by Corentin Jabot that
investigates implementation impact, though an implementation has not yet
been completed in an existing compiler. This paper also includes
discussion regarding alternative design possibilities.

# Changes since R0 # {#changes}

  - Updated the proposal to match the EWG design consensus reached in
    Prague. Removed the proposal options section.
  - Moved some content previously in the introduction section into a new
    history section.
  - Added results of SG16 and EWG polls taken in Prague.
  - Updated the existing practice section to correctly describe the name
    matching behavior of other languages where the behavior was
    previously uncertain.
  - Updated uses of `U+NNNN` to correctly follow Unicode notational
    conventions.

# History # {#history}

Prior presentations of P1097 to EWG-I and EWG received strong
encouragement and useful design feedback:

No consensus. Author encouraged to do further work


Two areas of concern were raised during [discussion in EWG in Belfast, 2019](http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21belfast/P1097-EWG):

  - **Implementation impact**
    The Unicode name database (names and aliases), in text form, is
    ~1.5 MiB and a naive implementation could significantly impact the
    size of compiler distributions. This was of particular concern to
    organizations that distribute compilers as part of a distributed
    build process.
  - **Design concerns**
    One EWG member strongly preferred a library based design that would
    have a smaller impact on the core language. For example, a string
    interpolation based design.

The implementation concerns prompted Corentin Jabot to explore implementation
strategies as described in the [Implementation experience](#experience)
section.

Despite the clear negative feedback from EWG-I with regard to use of
[@uax44-lm2] to match character names, [@P2071R0] proposed using
[@uax44-lm2].  This was motivated solely by Corentin Jabot's use of that
algorithm in his implementation experiments.

Presentation of P2071R0(https://wg21.link/p2071r0) to SG16 and EWG in
Prague received strong encouragement and consensus for design direction.

  - [SG16 in Prague, 2020](http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21prague/SG16P2071R0):
      -

**What is our preferred name matching algorithm?**

| In favor | Name match algorithm |
|----------|----------------------|
| 6        | Exact match.         |
| 6        | Case insensitive     |
| 4        | Full UAX44-LM2       |

No consensus for the UAX44-LM2 algorithm.




**We should support case-insensitive matching as opposed to exact match?**

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
|----|---|---|---|----|
| 2  | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2  |

Consensus? No

- SF: Matches implementations in other languages.
- SF: Mixed case is more legible than UPPERCASE.
- SA: This is an identifier in a case-sensitive language.
- SA: Increases maintenance in large code bases due to different style preferences; want one way to spell things.
- N: Want UAX44-LM2 because I'll constantly have to lookup correct names.




**Preferred syntax: (vote for 1)**

| In favor | Syntax                      |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| 8        | Use "\\N{XXX}"               |
| 0        | Use "\\u{XXX}" and "\\U{XXX}" |

Strong consensus for the originally proposed syntax.

- F: Want to reserve \u for other potential extensions
- F: Matches other languages like Python.




**Match name aliases?**

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
|----|---|---|---|----|
| 8  | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  |

Consensus? Yes



**Include support for ISO/IEC 10646 named sequences?**

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
|----|---|---|---|----|
| 0  | 0 | 1 | 6 | 1  |

Consensus? No
- SA: Adds implementation complexity for little benefit.
- A: Can be added later.



**Forward to EWG with: no UAX44-LM2 matching, no support for
        named sequences, use of \\N, and no recommendation regarding
        case-sensitivity.**

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
|----|---|---|---|----|
| 7  | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0  |

Consensus? Yes

- [EWG in Prague, 2020](http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21prague/P2071R0-EWG):


**We are interesting in supporting named universal character escapes**

 | SF | F | N | A | SA |
 |----|---|---|---|----|
 | 14 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0  |


**This should further support aliases**

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
|----|---|---|---|----|
| 18 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0  |



**It should further be case insensitive**

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
|----|---|---|---|----|
| 0  | 6 | 6 | 9 | 2  |



**It should further support UAX44-LM2 with arbitrary spaces and  dashes**

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
|----|---|---|---|----|
| 1  | 4 | 5 | 8 | 5  |

Here again, clear negative feedback was provided with regard to use of the
[@uax44-lm2] name matching algorithm. Additionally, the clearest guidance
obtained so far was provided with regard to case-insensitivity. Corentin Jabot
experimented and found that use of [@uax44-lm2] only reduced data size by
about 9K; this delta is not significant. Revision [@P2071R1] was therefore
modified to match the EWG consensus to require exact name matches only.

# Motivation # {#motivation}

The introduction of
[*universal-character-name*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s
in C++11 benefitted programmers by allowing them to portably encode
characters outside of the basic source character set without having to
resort to use of octal or hexadecimal
[*escape-sequence*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#nt:escape-sequence)s
to explicitly encode code units. However, Unicode code points by
themselves do not clearly communicate to readers of the code which
character is to be encoded; hence the code comments included with the
code examples in the introduction. Allowing programmers to directly use
Unicode assigned character names avoids the need for side channel
communications, like code comments, that might get out of sync over
time.

Use of UTF-8 as the encoding for source files has increased over time,
but impediments to adoption remain. For example, Microsoft Visual C++
still defaults to a locale dependent encoding and that encourages
limiting source files to ASCII. If the C++ community were to migrate en
masse to UTF-8, then one might question whether
[*universal-character-name*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s
would become a legacy backward compatibility feature since programmers
could reliably type the intended character in their source code
directly. And if
[*universal-character-name*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s
were to become an anachronism, then what use would be served by
introducing a named character escape?

Unicode defines a number of characters that, even when they can be typed
directly, can result in confusion. These include invisible characters
such as U+200B {ZERO WIDTH SPACE}, combining characters such as U+0300
{COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT}, visually indistinct characters such as U+003B
{SEMICOLON} and U+037E {GREEK QUESTION MARK}, and characters with RTL
(right-to-left) directionality. Consider how the following string
literals containing these characters are rendered. In cases like these,
use of escape sequences improves clarity; thus motivation for use of
Unicode escape sequences will remain.

Named character escapes are supported in various forms in other
programming languages. The following is the result of a brief survey of
various languages. For languages that include such support, more details
can be found in the [Design considerations](#design-considerations) section.

# Design considerations # {#design-considerations}

There are numerous choices for how support for named characters can be
integrated into C++. Useful questions for making design choices include:

  - Which names will be recognized? Can multiple names for the same
    character exist?
  - How will names be matched? Must they be exact? Case insensitive?
  - How will support for new names affect backward compatibility?
  - How will the requirement for a name database impact implementations?
  - What syntax to use?
  - What is existing practice in other languages?

This section analyzes the various options considered for this proposal.

## Syntax ## {#syntax}

Named character escapes are proposed as a more readable alternative to
[universal-character-name](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s.
As such, it is desirable that they be similar in syntax to
[universal-character-name](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s
and other existing escape sequences.

The syntax proposed by Fernandes in [@P1097R2] "Named character escapes") is
modeled after the syntax adopted for Python and consists of a `\N` escape
introducer followed by a name enclosed in curly brackets. For example:

```C++

    '\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A}'

    "\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON}"

```

Other choices for the escape introducer are possible; the [Backward
compatibility] section discusses some possible
motivation for preferring `\u` and/or `\U`.

Options for recognized names and how to match them are discussed in
subsequent sections.

As proposed, only one name is allowed per named character escape, but
that is an artificial limitation. Raku allows a sequence of comma
separated names to be specified in a single escape. This is a natural
extension if names are permitted to identify sequences of characters
instead of a single character. The following would all be equivalent.
This proposal leaves this option to a future extension; see the
[Possible future extensions](#extensions) section.

```C++

    "\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON, COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT}"
    "\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON}\N{COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT}"
    "\u0100\u0300"

```

Perl and Raku both allow Unicode code point numbers to be specified as
character names. Following suit would enable a syntax that avoids the
strict 4 or 8 digit requirements of
[universal-character-name](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s
and could allow the natural `U+NNNN` style frequently used to identify
Unicode characters. The following could all be equivalent. This proposal
also leaves this option for a future extension as discussed in the
[Possible future extensions](#extensions) section.

```C++
    "\N{U+0100}"
    "\N{U+100}"
    "\N{U+000100}"
    "\N{0x0100}"
    "\N{256}"
    "\u0100"
```

## Name sources ## {#sources}

A named character escape feature is not particularly useful unless
accompanied by at least one source of character names. The following
list contains sources of character names that are consulted by at least
one implementation of named character escapes in another programming
language.

  - [Unicode assigned names (synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646)](https://www.unicode.org/Public/12.0.0/ucd/NamesList.txt)
  - [Unicode aliases (synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646)](https://www.unicode.org/Public/12.0.0/ucd/NameAliases.txt)
  - [Unicode named sequences (synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646)](https://www.unicode.org/Public/12.0.0/ucd/NamedSequences.txt)
  - [Emoji ZWJ sequences](https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/4.0/emoji-zwj-sequences.txt)
  - [Emoji sequences](https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/4.0/emoji-sequences.txt)
  - [HTML named character references](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html#named-character-references)

The first three are defined by the Unicode Consortium, part of the
Unicode standard, and synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646. The names
specified in each are designed in concert, share a common namespace, are
immutable once published, and Unicode guarantees no conflicts between
them. See the [Unicode character encoding stability
policy](https://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html "Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policies")
for more details. These sources are consulted for named character
escapes in Perl, Python, and Raku.

The next two sources specify emoji character sequences. Though produced
by the Unicode Consortium, they are not part of the Unicode standard,
and are not covered by the [Unicode character encoding stability
policy](https://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html "Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policies")
These two sources don't technically provide names; they provide optional
descriptions. The provided descriptions use characters, particularly `:`
and `,`, that are disallowed in the names provided by the first three
sources. These sources are consulted for named character escapes in
Raku.

The last source is the specification of names recognized for use as
named character references in HTML documents. This source is used for
the implementation of named character escapes in the D programming
language.

The stability guarantees offered by the Unicode standard are a strong
motivator for their use and, as such, this proposal adopts them as the
name sources to use.

The list of Unicode assigned names associates at most one name with each
character. There are some characters that are not assigned a name in
this list, for example, U+0080 is simply listed as a `<control>`
character with no name. In some of these cases, the Unicode aliases list
provides one or more names. For example, U+0080 has assigned aliases of
`PADDING CHARACTER` (a figment alias) and `PAD` (an abbreviation alias).

Unicode aliases provide another critical service. As mentioned above,
once assigned, names are immutable. Corrections are only offered by
providing an alias. Aliases come in five varieties:

  - **correction**
    Aliases for cases where an incorrect assigned name was published.
    For example, U+FE18 has an assigned name of `PRESENTATION FORM FOR
    VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRAKCET` and a correction alias of
    `PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET`
    (note the typo correction).
  - **control**
    Aliases for various control characters. For example, `NULL` for
    U+0000.
  - **alternate**
    Aliases for widely used alternate names. For example, `BYTE ORDER
    MARK` for U+FEFF.
  - **figment**
    Aliases for names that were documented, but never accepted in a
    standard. For example, `HIGH OCTET PRESET` for U+0081.
  - **abbreviation**
    Aliases for common abbreviations. For example, `NBSP` for U+00A0.

It is conceivable that implementors could desire, or be requested to, support
additional implementation-defined names; perhaps including from the additional
sources listed above. Since new characters and names will continue to be added
to the Unicode standard, caution is warranted to avoid the possibility of
introducing conflicting names over time. The description of the [@uax44-lm2]
name matching algorithm describes a historical case of how such a conflict once
occurred. Any support for additional names should ensure that they occupy a
non-overlapping namespace with the Unicode assigned names. Out of caution, this
proposal disallows additional implementation-defined names.

## Name matching ## {#name-matching}

Names can be finicky things. Having to remember whether a name is, for
example, `ZERO WIDTH SPACE` or `ZERO-WIDTH SPACE` is likely to frustrate
programmers. Some programmers might prefer `zero width space`.

Unicode provides a straight forward algorithm for matching names with various
allowances including case-insensitivity, omission of some hyphens (`-`), and
substitution of underscore (`_`) for space characters.  [@uax44-lm2] is
included in the Unicode standard via [@uax44].

The [@uax44-lm2] matching rule would accept any of the following names as a
match for U+200B {ZERO WIDTH SPACE}

```
    ZERO WIDTH SPACE
    ZERO-WIDTH SPACE
    zero-width space
    ZERO width S P_A_C E
```
## Portable names ## {#portable-names}

Portably using named character escapes will require implementations to
agree on a minimum version of the name sources.

Thanks to the adoption of
[@P1025R1]"Update The Reference To The Unicode Standard")
in Rapperswil, 2019, the C++ standard has a normative floating reference
to [ISO/IEC 10646](https://www.iso.org/standard/69119.html) "Information technology — Universal Coded Character Set (UCS)",
the ISO/IEC standard that specifies a subset of what is specified in the
Unicode standard and is kept synchronized with it. ISO/IEC 10646:2017
includes the Unicode assigned names (in section 33), name aliases (in
section 33), and named character sequences (in section 27).

The floating reference to ISO/IEC 10646 indicates a dependence on the
version that is current at the time of standardization. Thus,
conformance with the C++ standard will require conformance with the
latest available publication of ISO/IEC 10646.

Implementors must be allowed, and encouraged, to conform to more recent
versions of ISO/IEC 10646 as they are published.

## Existing practice ## {#existing-practice}

Support for named escape sequences exists in several programming
languages. The following details of existing practice were obtained from
these documentation sources.

## Backward compatibility ## {#back-compat}

Escape sequences beyond those required in the standard are
conditionally-supported
([\[lex.ccon\]p7](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#7.sentence-3)). For
implementations that currently define a meaning for `\N` in character or
string literals, the use of `\N` in this proposal is technically a
breaking change.

Gcc, Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++ all accept `\N` as an escape
sequence with the semantic effect of substituting `N` such that
`"\N{xxx}"` is equivalent to `"N{xxx}"`. However, they each emit a
warning regarding an unrecognized escape sequence, so reliance on this
behavior is not likely to be common. Still, there are likely to be some
uses in the wild (probably some percentage of that were intended to be
`\n`).

Another option would be to reuse the `\u` and/or `\U` introducer used
for
[*universal-character-name*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s.
Gcc and Clang both reject code like `"\u{xxx}"` and `"\U{xxx}"` as
containing ill-formed
[*universal-character-name*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s.
However, Microsoft Visual C++ accepts such uses without a warning and
treats them as equivalent to `"u{xxx}` and `"U{xxx}"` respectively.

The implementation divergence that occurs for the `\u` and `\U` cases
above suggests that repurposing them may reduce the potential for
backward compatibility impact. Use of `\u` and/or `\U` would potentially
require more wording changes to distinguish named character escapes from
[*universal-character-name*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s,
but would be unlikely to pose a significant additional impact to
implementors.

For now, this proposal adheres to Fernandes' original design and retains
use of `\N` as the introducer for named character escapes.

## Implementor impact ## {#impact}

The sources of character names listed in the [Name
sources](#sources) section do not constitute big data by today's
standards, but that does not mean that the volume of data and potential
for impact to compiler distributions and compiler performance is
insignificant. As mentioned earlier, some organizations have valid
technical reasons to be sensitive to the size of the compiler
distributions they use; in a distributed build environment that
distributes compilers, the size of the distribution impacts latency and
can therefore negatively impact build times.

The combined size of the Unicode 12.0 text files containing the Unicode
assigned names, aliases, and named character sequences is approximately
1.5 MiB. A naive implementation might contribute 2+ MiB of code/data to
a compiler. Some EWG members indicated that amount of increase is a
cause for concern.

Fortunately, naive implementations are not the only option. Corentin
Jabot has done some excellent work to demonstrate that an implementation
should be possible that increases the code/data size of a compiler by
less than 300 KiB. See the [Implementation
experience](#experience) section for details. Corentin's
approach is promising, but the additional complexity caries additional
implementation cost and maintenance.

Staying up to date with new Unicode releases will also, of course, pose
an additional cost on implementors.

## Design alternatives ## {#alternatives}

As indicated previously, at least one EWG member in Belfast was strongly
interested in a more general core language feature, presumably a string
interpolation facility, that would allow named character escapes to be
implemented as a library feature. Such a feature could take many forms,
but might look something like the following where `\{` is an escape
sequence followed by a call to a `constexpr` function named `nce` with
arguments passed in some form.

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">

    "\{nce(LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE)}"

</div>

Such a feature could certainly be implemented, but would seem to
necessarily be more verbose and would necessitate inclusion of
appropriate headers; headers that would be quite large in the case of a
named character database or that would make use of a compiler intrinsic;
which would put the complexity back in the compiler (though in
implementation-defined territory rather than in standard core language).
The verbosity concern could potentially be reduced by introducing core
language sugar for lowering the proposed syntax to the example string
interpolation syntax above.

# Proposal # {#proposal}

The wording included in this proposal is for the following design:

  - Context:
      - Named character escapes are valid only in character and string
        literals (not in identifiers).
  - Syntax:
      - `\N{xxx}` where `xxx` is the name of the character.
  - Name sources:
      - ISO/IEC 10646 assigned names.
      - ISO/IEC 10646 assigned name aliases.
      - No allowance for additional implementation-defined names.
  - Name matching:
      - case-sensitive and whitespace-sensitive exact matches.
  - Feature test macro:
      - `__cpp_named_character_escapes`

# Possible future extensions # {#extensions}

The following options are *not* currently proposed but could be
considered for future extension.

1.  Allow comma separated names. For example:
      - `"\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON, COMBINING GRAVE
        ACCENT}" // Equivalent to "\u0100\u0300"`
2.  Allow code point numbers as names. For example:
      - `"\N{U+00C0}" // Equivalent to "\u00C0"`
      - `"\N{0x00C0}" // Equivalent to "\u00C0"`
      - `"\N{192}"    // Equivalent to "\u00C0"`
3.  Allow names to match ISO/IEC 10646 named sequences such that the
    following would be equivalent:
      - `"\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON AND GRAVE}"`
      - `"\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON}\N{COMBINING GRAVE
        ACCENT"`
      - `"\u0100\u0300"`
4.  Allow names to match Unicode emoji named sequences. For example:
      - `"\N{keycap: #}"                     // Equivalent to
        "\u0023\uFE0F\u20E3"`
      - `"\N{Czech Republic}"                // Equivalent to
        "\U0001F1E8\U0001F1FF"`
      - `"\N{waving hand: medium skin tone}" // Equivalent to
        "\U0001F1E8\U0001F1FF"`
5.  Allow names to match Unicode emoji ZWJ named sequences. For example:
      - `"\N{man shrugging: medium skin tone}" // Equivalent to
        "\U0001F937\U0001F3FD\u200D\u2642\uFE0F"`
      - `"\N{rainbow flag}"                    // Equivalent to
        "\U0001F3F3\uFE0F\u200D\U0001F308"`
6.  Allow names to match HTML 5 named character references by
    surrounding them with `&` and `;`. For example:
      - `"\N{&Agrave;}" // Equivalent to "\u00C0"`

# Implementation experience # {#experience}

This proposal has not yet been implemented in an existing compiler.
However, the implementation concerns raised in Belfast prompted Corentin
Jabot to conduct an experiement to determine how small the
implementation overhead, in terms of data and code within the compiler,
could be reduced to. His [blog
post](https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/cp_to_name "Storing Unicode: Character Name to Codepoint Mapping")
on the experiment reported that he was able to implement a function
([`cp_from_name`](https://github.com/cor3ntin/ext-unicode-db/blob/name_to_cp/name_to_cp.hpp#L215-L260))
that accepts a Unicode 12.0 name or name alias and returns a code point
value in under 300 KiB. His implementation is available in the
`cp_to_name` branch of his `ext-unicode-db` GitHub repository at
[https://github.com/cor3ntin/ext-unicode-db/tree/name\_to\_cp](https://github.com/cor3ntin/ext-unicode-db/tree/name_to_cp "ext-unicode-db")

# Acknowledgements # {#acknowledgements}

Thank you to R. Martinho Fernandes for taking the initiative to research
and first propose support for named character escapes and for
contributing his considerable expertise in general to SG16.

Thank you to Corentin Jabot for the excellent work he did experimenting
with and analyzing implementation impact. Without his work, the data
necessary to respond to the implementation concerns raised in Belfast
would not have been available at this time, thereby delaying further
progress on this proposal.

Thank you to Peter Bindels and Corentin Jabot for providing feedback on
an initial draft that I delivered to them less than two hours before the
Prague pre-meeting mailing deadline\!

Change in [5.13.3 \[lex.ccon\]
paragraph 7](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#7):

> Certain non-graphic characters, the single quote `'`, the double quote
> `"`, the question mark
> `?`,<sup>[19](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#footnote-19)</sup> and
> the backslash `\`, can be represented according to Table
> [8](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#tab:lex.ccon.esc). The double
> quote `"` and the question mark `?`, can be represented as themselves
> or by the escape sequences `\"` and `\?` respectively, but the single
> quote `'` and the backslash `\` shall be represented by the escape
> sequences `\'` and `\\` respectively. Escape sequences in which the
> character following the backslash is not listed in Table
> [8](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#tab:lex.ccon.esc) are
> conditionally-supported, with implementation-defined semantics. An
> escape sequence specifies a single character.

Add a new paragraph (X) after [5.13.3 \[lex.ccon\]
paragraph 9](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#9):
*Drafting Note:* Associated character names and character name aliases
are listed in section 33 of ISO/IEC 10646:2017.

> A
> [*named-escape-sequence*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#nt:named-escape-sequence)
> is translated to the encoding, in the appropriate execution character
> set, of the character associated with the ISO/IEC 10646 `associated
> character name\` or `character name alias` that matches the name
> specified by the
> [*n-char-sequence*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#nt:n-char-sequence).
> Matching of names is case-sensitive and whitespace-sensitive. If no
> name is matched, then the program is ill-formed.

Change in [5.13.5 \[lex.string\]
paragraph 14](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.string#14):

> Escape sequences and
> [*universal-character-name*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s
> in non-raw string literals have the same meaning as in [character
> literals](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon)
> ([\[lex.ccon\]](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon)), except that the
> single quote `'` is representable either by itself or by the escape
> sequence `\'`, and the double quote `"` shall be preceded by a `\`,
> and except that a

> <span class="underline">or
> [*named-escape-sequence*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#nt:named-escape-sequence)</span>
> in a UTF-16 string literal may yield a surrogate pair. In a narrow

> [*named-escape-sequence*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#nt:named-escape-sequence)</span>
> may map to more than one `char\` or `char8_t` element due to
> [*multibyte
> encoding*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.string#def:encoding,multibyte).
> The size of a `char32_t` or wide string literal is the total number of
> escape sequences,
> [*universal-character-name*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s,
> <span class="underline">[*named-escape-sequence*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#nt:named-escape-sequence)s,</span>
> and other characters, plus one for the terminating `U'\0'` or `L'\0'`.
> The size of a UTF-16 string literal is the total number of escape

> <span class="underline">[*named-escape-sequence*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.ccon#nt:named-escape-sequence)s,</span>
> and other characters, plus one for each character requiring a
> surrogate pair, plus one for the terminating `u'\0'`. \[ *Note:* The
> size of a `char16_t` string literal is the number of code units, not
> the number of characters. — *end note* \] Within `char32_t` and
> `char16_t` string literals, any
> [*universal-character-name*](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#nt:universal-character-name)s
> shall be within the range `0x0` to `0x10FFFF`. The size of a narrow

Change in table 17 of [15.11 \[cpp.predefined\]
paragraph 1.8](http://eel.is/c++draft/cpp.predefined#1.8):
*Drafting note:* the final value for the `__cpp_named_character_escapes`
feature test macro will be selected by the project editor to reflect the
date of approval.
